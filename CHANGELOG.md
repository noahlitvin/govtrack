-----
* Initial release

1.0.0

* Update gem to use version 2 of the GovTrack API. The API changed in many ways, and this version is not backwards-compatible with version 0.0.1 (hence the bump of the major-number in the version).

1.1.0 (December 27th 2013)
-----
* Added functionality for working with Committee, Committee_member, and Cosponsorship data. This library now supports all the resources available in version 2 of the GovTrack API.
